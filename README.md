# StringARMplotter
 Plotter firmware based loosely on the Stringent plotter: https://github.com/snebragd/stringent
 Ported to run on an Adafruit Grand Central M4: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4064
 Modified to:
 -Use Gcode generated by Gcodetools in Inkscape, with tool set to Tangent Knife and an inverted Y-axis
 -Use time-based acceleration with a look-ahead of a configurable number of points
 -Run motor timings independently
 -Touchscreen (ILI9341 and FT6206) and Bluetooth (ArduinoBlue https://github.com/purwar2016/ArduinoBlue-library ) operation instead of IR remote
 -Many other changes

 Libraries used:
 SPI (native)
 SD (native)
